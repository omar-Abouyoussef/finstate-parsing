A limited review is substantially less in scope than an audit. conducted in accordance with Egyptian Standards on Auditing and consequently does. not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these condensed interim consolidated financial statements..\n\nPage 3\n---\n\n## Hazem Hassan\n\n\n## Translation from Arabic\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nBased on our limited review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe. that the accompanying March 31, 2025, condensed consolidated interim financial. statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with Egyptian Accounting Standard number (30) \"Interim Financial Reporting\".\n\nCairo, 26 May 2025\n\n\nkPHG Hazew Hassu KPMG Hazem Hassan Public Accountants & Consultants\n\nKPMG Hazem Hassan Public Accountants and Consultants\n\nPage 4\n---\n\nTranslated from Arabic\n\n\nEJsewedy Electric Company\n\n\n## (An Egyptian Joint Stock Company)\n\n\nCondensed Consolidated interim Statement of Financial Position as of:\n\n\n| EGP | Note | 31March2025 | 31 December 2024 |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Assets | (17) | 29130097718 | 27 543 762 675 |\n| Property,plant and equipment | (19) | 475 767 564 | 496 953 678 |\n| Right of use assets | (18) | 59658346 | 60026536 |\n| Investment property | (20) | 6690220038 | 6 474 047 538 |\n| Equity-accounted investees | (38) | 172 559 319 | 133 150 622 |\n| Due from related parties Trade and other receivables | (21) | 995464493 | 1 894 117 052 |\n| Intangible assets and goodwill | (22) | 1561803772 | 1459194548 |\n| Deferred tax assets | (14-1) | 2277071165 | 2362 632290 |\n| Non-current assets |  | 41362642415 | 40423884939 |\n|  | (23) | 56981867280 | 56 795 884 068 |\n| Inventories | 25 | 52547 1055  47 | 18.05 966.570 |\n| Contract assets Industrial real state development | (24) | 6283444 579 | 6 164 646988 |\n| Trade and other receivables | (26) | 95135630854 | 86736309423 |\n| Due from related parties | (38) | 2516 084788 | 2 299 918 506 |\n| Investments in debt securities at amortized |  | 197 974 211 | 874 525 871 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | (27) (28) | 221703494 532 | 209 103253748 |\n| cost |  | 42 249 239 273 | 38 180002 322 |\n| Current assets Total assets |  | 263066136947 | 249 527 138 687 |\n| Equity | (29) | 2140777876 | 2 140777 876 |\n| Issued and paid-up capital ESOP shares issued not granted |  | (1 422 160) | (1 422 160) |\n|  | (30) | 8039250764 | 8 514 968 667 |\n| Reserves |  | 48657593059 | 44 620 588 973 |\n| Retained earnings |  |  |  |\n| Eauity attributable to owners of the |  | 58836 199539 | 55274 913356 |\n| parent company |  |  |  |\n| Non-controlling interests | (41) | 5042699287 | 4 251 771 900 |\n| Total equity |  | 63878898826 | 59 526 685 256 |\n| Liabilities Loans and borrowings | (32) | 6788812854 | 6 349 010 708 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities | (14-2) | 3670622640 | 3 669892 743 |\n| Due to related parties | (38) | 96081811 | 94 611 605 |\n| Provisions | (35) | 955 378 650 | 942 646031 |\n| Other liabilities | (42) | 2 443 528057 | 2 631 482 147 |\n| Non-current liabilities |  | 13954424012 | 13687 643234 |\n|  | (32) | 48631928092 | 52 733 931 099 |\n| Loans and borrowings Trade and other payables | (33) | 61204045494 | 54808 185042 |\n|  | 3 () | 59466651465 | 53281056753 |\n| Contract liabilities Due to related parties | (38) | 2 447 758 746 | 2 050078425 |\n| Provisions | (35) | 13482430312 | 13439558878 |\n| Current liabilities |  | 185232814109 | 176312810197 |\n| Total liabilities |  | 199187238121 | 190000453 431 |\n| Total equity and liabilities |  | 263066136947 | 249527138687 |\n\n\nThe notes from no.(1) to (43) are an integral part of these condensed consolidated interim financial statemenis.\n\nGroup Chiel Financial Officer\n\n\nMr. Ahmed Shokry\n\n\n\"Limited review repon \"Auached\n\n\nManaging Director\n\n\nEng.

The   goodwill impairment test is carried out at the Company level. The determination is made through the present value of   the estimated future cash flows, as expected to be generated by CGU- by applying (Discounted Cash Flow Method).   Cash flows are estimated using the most recent budgets approved by the management, and based on reasonable and   justified assumptions, which represent the best possible and updated information available at the reporting date. The   management  evaluates  the  rationality  of  the  underlying  assumptions  with  regard  to  the  projected  cash  flows  by   identifying the causes of differences between past and current projected cash flows. The management also ensures that   the assumptions used in estimating the currently projected cash flows are consistent with past actual results.
