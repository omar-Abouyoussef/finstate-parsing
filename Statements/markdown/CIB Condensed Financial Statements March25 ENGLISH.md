Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with the rules of preparation and presentation of the bank's. financial statements and the basis of recognition and measurement approved by the Central Bank of Egypt board of directors on 16 December 2008 as amended by regulations issued on. 26 February 2019 and its subsequent interpretive instructions and Central Bank of Egypt board of directors resolution on 3 May 2020 regarding issuing condensed interim financial statements. for banks and with the requirements of applicable Egyptian laws and regulations, our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our review.\n\n## Scope of Review\n\n\nWe conducted our review in accordance with Egyptian Standard on review engagements (2410).. \"Review of interim financial statements performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\". A review of condensed consolidated interim financial statements consists of making inquiries. primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters in the bank, and applying. analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Egyptian Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable. us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these condensed. consolidated interim financial statements..\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the rules of preparation and presentation of the bank's. financial statements and the basis of recognition and measurement approved by the Central Bank. of Egypt board of directors on 16 December 2008 as amended by regulations issued on. 26 February 2019 and its subsequent interpretive instructions and Central Bank of Egypt board of directors resolution on 3 May 2020 regarding issuing condensed interim financial statements for banks and with the requirements of applicable Egyptian laws and regulations.\n\nCairo; 12 May 2025\n\n\n## Auditors\n\n\n## Farid Samir Farid\n\n\nHds&amMohamed' Hial Financial Regtlatory Authority Register Number \"147' Baker Tilly Mohamaed Hilal -Wanid Abdel Ghaffar Public Accounfahfs-& Consultants\n\nFinancial Regulatgry-AuthoQoy Register Number \"210' Saleh, Barspum & AbdelAziz - Grant Thornton.

Interest rate risk\n\n\nThe Bank addresses exposure to the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates that arises from the re-pricing maturity structure of interest-sensitive   assets and liabilities. It is assessed for both the earnings and economic value perspectives. The Board sets limits on the interest rate repricing gaps that may be undertaken, which   is monitored by the bank's Risk Management Department.(cid:9)\n\n## 3.5. Liquidity risk\n\n\nLiquidity risk specifies the Bank’s inability to replace withdrawn funds and meet consequential payment obligations due to the fall of financial liabilities.  The consequence may be the failure to meet obligations to repay depositors and fulfill commitments to lend.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Management Organization and Measurement Tools\n\n\nLiquidity Risk is governed by Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and Board Risk Committee (BRC) subject to provisions of Treasury Policy Guide (TPG).  Board Risk Committee (BRC): Provides oversight of risk management functions and assesses compliance to the set risk strategies and policies approved by the Board of Directors   (BoD) through periodic reports submitted by the Risk Group. The committee makes recommendations to the BoD with regards to risk management strategies and policies   (including those related to capital adequacy, liquidity management, various types of risks: credit, market, operation, compliance, reputation and any other risks the Bank may be   exposed to).\n\nAsset & Liability Committee (ALCO): Optimizes the allocation of assets and liabilities, taking into consideration expectations of the potential impact of future interest rate   fluctuations, liquidity constraints, and foreign exchange exposures. ALCO monitors the Bank’s liquidity and market risks, economic developments, market fluctuations, and risk   profile to ensure ongoing activities are compatible with the risk/ reward guidelines approved by the BoD.\n\nTreasury Policy Guide (TPG): The function of the TPG is to document and communicate the policies that govern the activities performed by the Treasury Group and monitored   by Risk Group.\n\nThe main measures and monitoring tools used to assess the Bank’s liquidity risk include regulatory and internal ratios, gaps, Basel III liquidity ratios, asset and liability gapping   mismatch, stress testing, and funding base concentration.\n\nMore conservative internal targets and Risk Appetite indicators (RAI) against regulatory requirements are set for various measures of Liquidity and Funding Concentration Risks.  At the end of period, the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) maintained strong and well above regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Bank maintained a solid LCY & FCY Liquidity position with decent buffers to meet both the global and local  increase in risk profile. CIB will continue with  its robust   Liability strategy with reliance on customer deposits (stable funding) as the main contributor of total liabilities, and low dependency on the Wholesale Funding. CIB has  ample   levels of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) based on its  LCY & FCY Sovereign Portfolio investments, which positively reflects the Bank's solid Liquidity Ratios and Basel III   LCR & NSFR ratios, with a large buffer maintained above the Regulatory ratios’ requirements.\n\n## Liquidity Management\n\n\nThe Bank’s approach is to maintain a prudent Liquidity position with a Liability driven strategy, as almost the entire funding base is customer based stable deposits  rather than   wholesale funding; which is a core component of the Risk Appetite. This is coupled with ample amounts of Liquid Assets. To limit potential Liquidity shocks, the Bank has a well-  established Contingency Funding Plan (CFP), where Liquidity Risk is assessed in line with all Regulatory and Internal Liquidity Measurements, and Basel II and III requirements;   including Liquidity Stress Testing; and Basel III Ratios; Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR).(cid:9)\n\nFor March 2025 NSFR ratio recorded 239% (LCY 233% and FCY 250%), and LCR ratio record 942% (LCY 1503% and FCY 392%).  For December 2024 NSFR ratio record 238% (LCY 239% and FCY 236%), and LCR ratio record  1037% (LCY 1709% and FCY 403%).  For March 2025 CAR ratio recorded 26.8%, and 24.1% for December 2024.  For March 2025 Leverage ratio recorded 10.6%, and 9.6% for December 2024.\n\n8\n\n\nPage 16\n---\n\nB {CIB y sI sw} yOo - J9u COMMERCIAL INTERNATIONAL BANK - EGYPT (CIB)\n\n\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts are shown in EGP thousands).\n\n\n## 3.6.

Share-based payments\n\n\nAccording to the extraordinary general assembly meeting on June 26, 2006, the Bank launched new Employees Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) scheme and   issued equity-settled share-based payments. Eligible employees must complete a term of 3 years of service in the bank to have the right in ordinary shares at   face value (right to share) that will be issued on the vesting date, otherwise such grants will be forfeited. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured   at fair value at the grant date, and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting year (3 years) with corresponding increase in equity based on estimated   number of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value for such equity instruments is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model.\n\nDetails of the rights to share outstanding during the period / year are as follows:\n\n|  | Mar.31, 2025  No. of shares in   thousand | Dec.31, 2024  No. of shares in   thousand |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Outstanding at the beginning of the period / year | 75,874 | 80,013 |\n| Granted during the period / year | 26,127 | 22,869 |\n| Forfeited during the period / year | (892) | (3,351) |\n| Exercised during the period / year | (27,693) | (23,657) |\n| Outstanding at the end of the period / year | 73,416 | 75,874 |\n\n\nDetails of the outstanding tranches are as follows:\n\n\n| Maturity date | Exercise price  EGP | EGP Fair value | No. of shares in   thousand |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 2026 | 10.00 | 34.09 | 25,586 |\n| 2027 | 10.00 | 66.15 | 21,703 |\n| 2028 | 10.00 | 66.48 | 26,127 |\n| Total |  |  | 73,416 |\n\n\nThe fair value of granted shares is calculated using Black-Scholes pricing model with the following:\n\n\n|  | 19th tranche | 18th tranche |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Exercise price | 10 | 10 |\n| Current share price | 78.5 | 72.65 |\n| Expected life (years) | 3 | 3 |\n| Risk free rate % | 23.98% | 23.99% |\n| Dividend yield% | 3.20% | 0.80% |\n| Volatility% | 38.28% | 36.79% |\n\n\nVolatility is calculated based on the standard deviation of returns for the last five years.\n\n\n## 24 .
